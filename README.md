Project Idea:  Slay the Spire Clone Simplified
Create a game where the user has a deck of cards they use to fight monsters they encounter.

Goal: Get as far as we can in 3 days.

Note: Came down with a fever on day 2 that lasted 75% of the project window.  Thanks to the suggestion of our lead we had planned our project out well and were able to scale appropriately to hit release.  Shout out to Keith.

Enhancement Idea:
When they beat a monster they get to choose a reward card that will be added to their deck.

Features: 
	JS: [Deck Shuffler, Deck Object, Stat Tracking for player/monsters, Room Transitions]
	CSS: [Card Images, Monster Images, Backgrounds] 
	CSS Enhancements:[Make the card drawing look smooth, visual on hit monster, visual on hit player/lose hp]
	DOM: [Stat Reflection, Clickable Cards, Pass Turn Button, Targetable Monsters]
